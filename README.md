# Fractal Tree Viewer

This is a simple Java application that demonstrates recursion by visualizing a fractal tree. It takes in an input for
length, angle and the number of child nodes and draws to a canvas. These inputs can then be manipulated by the sliders
and text field. It utilizes Java, JavaFX, FXML and CSS.

//	TODO:
make object oriented for multiple tree and shape types
remove canvas from controller so that we can resize canvas to parent but also draw on init
